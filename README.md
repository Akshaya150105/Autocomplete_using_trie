#Search Engine Auto Completion Using Trie

This project is a search engine built using Streamlit and Trie Data Structure to provide fast and efficient autocomplete suggestions. 
It includes various features like search history tracking, category-based search, search analytics, and real-time suggestions. The system uses a file-based approach to store and manage search history, making it persistent even across app restarts.
